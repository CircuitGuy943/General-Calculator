This is a general calculator that im currently working on which uses tkinter (https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) for its pop-up windows.
Currently it supports only +, -, *, / and ^ all in BIDMAS operational order (But without the brackets).
It also is able to work decimals, but be carefull, too big decimals may give unreliable results.
After typing in your equation press the "Calculate!" button to work it out, it also prevents you from spamming the same answer!
